MongoDB CRUD Operations Checkpoint
This project demonstrates fundamental MongoDB CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a "contact" database with a "contactlist" collection. The implementation showcases various MongoDB commands including insertMany() for document creation, find() with query operators ($gt, $and, $or, ...) for data retrieval, updateOne() with $set for modifications, and deleteMany() for removing documents. Key operations include filtering contacts by age (>18), searching for name patterns containing "ah", updating a contact's information, and deleting records of individuals under 5 years old. This checkpoint serves as practical exercise in understanding MongoDB's query syntax and data manipulation capabilities.
